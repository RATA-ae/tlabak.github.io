				Electric-Electric Guitar Embedded System

			<p>
				An interesting name, isn’t it? As one who is quite interested in the art of music and the creation of instruments, it was natural to make an embedded system that assumes all aspects of being a musical device. An electric guitar isn’t quite like the electric-electric guitar with one differing aspect: the creation of sound. In an electric guitar, one plucks a metal string to vibrate at a specific frequency, to change the magnetic field of the pickup component, which effectively induces an electromotive force (EMF) creating an electrical signal to be amplified. In essence, this process is more so a mechanical conversion to electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. In the electric-electric guitar, all signals are created internally by the microcontroller of the embedded system. Using embedded C, an electric signal is created computationally through logic and signal processing. The guitar mechanical strings are replaced by sensors to actuate a sound wave at a particular frequency by a touch event. Such an instrument allows for the extension of creativity with what one can do and produce whilst playing this guitar, removing the limiting element of mechanical sound creation to digitally being able to create unique sounds and process the signal directly to apply cool effects for a different auditory experience.

				Wireless Transmission of Power Between Electronic Devices

			<h3>
				Power Electronics

			<p>
				Wireless Transmission of Power (WTP) is a sophisticated, marvelous attribute of nature in electrodynamics. It involves transmitting electrical power without a physical link and, in near-field applications, utilizing time-varying electromagnetic (EM) fields to transfer power wirelessly. The purpose of the project for wireless transmission of power between electronic devices is to mitigate the need for a physical link between a source and a load for mobile devices, which effectively decreases the requirement for additional infrastructure within the power system and the increase of range for an electronic device to receive power liberally. Additionally, experimentation allowed for the exploration of defining how the parameters of a wireless power electronics system dictated the efficiency of the power transfer, aiming to achieve the ideal combination of parameter conditions for a greater efficiency. This project focused on developing a power electronics PCB module that ought to be implemented within personal electronic devices, such as a smart phone or a laptop computer.

				32-bit Pipelined CPU Design with New ALU Architecture

			<h3>
				VLSI Case Study
			</h3> -->
			<p>
				The purpose of this case study is to gain a further understanding of different 32-bit pipelined central processing unit (CPU) designs performance; the comparison between different full-bit adders to showcase the delays, power consumption, and processing frequency for each design. Coupled with the concern of having a fast, high-performing CPU, a new arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architecture should be implemented and compared to the pre-existing full-adder designs. A pipelined CPU is capable of handling many instructions at once, and in this design, the CPU uses 32-bit length words, therefore the architecture for processing a plethora of computations in unison becomes critical in its front-end and back-end design optimization. The integration of the CPU is synchronized by an external clock and other signals to direct operations and operands for the ALU and instructions for addressing the memory file. Using the environments Cadence Virtuoso, Xcelium, Genus, and Innovus, along with the RTL design being written in Verilog HDL, allowed for the compilation, construction, and simulation of developing a high-performing, fast processing CPU.
